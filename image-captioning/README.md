This project is aimed at understanding the following model architectures by building
an application for image captioning purpose i.e. generating sequences of coherent, suitable and concise sentences for given images : 

    1. Recurrent Neural Networks
    2. Long Short Term Memory
    3. and secondarily, CNNs for Feature extraction.

It is of course clear to me that as of 2023, this framework is not state of art. However, I still feel that such a project would enable me to apply my knowledge in RNN and LSTMs in a positive manner and teach me a few things along the way as well

Dataset Used - The Dataset to be used initially will be the Flickr 8k Dataset. This is a fairly straightforward dataset good enough for now.


Model architecture Used Initially - I will be aiming to use a basic CNN for feature extraction from these images in the beginning such as either the Xception Model and either a custom RNN or a similar architecture to something I can find in available literature.
